# Introduction
The intention of this page in GitHub is to consolidate my journey and self study process in the Data Engineering field.
You will find notes,samples and labs about Apache Spark. Later on I will include several Apache Spark/Databricks projects
I'm currently working on as I find this as way to absorb and properly understand new knowledge in these technologies.

If you're interested in this subject then you will find this repo useful to start getting your feet wet in these technologies.

Please note this is in a "work in progress" state so the content will keep changing.
